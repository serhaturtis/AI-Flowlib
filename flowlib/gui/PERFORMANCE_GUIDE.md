# GUI Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

The Flowlib GUI includes comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization features to ensure smooth operation even with large configurations and complex workflows.

## Performance Monitoring

### Core Features

The `PerformanceMonitor` service provides:

- **Operation Tracking**: Automatic timing of all controller operations
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, and resource usage monitoring
- **Performance Alerts**: Automatic detection of slow operations and resource issues
- **Historical Data**: Performance trends and operation statistics

### Usage

```python
# Get performance monitor from service factory
performance_monitor = service_factory.get_performance_monitor()

# Start system monitoring
performance_monitor.start_monitoring(interval=5.0)

# Manual operation tracking
with performance_monitor.profile_operation("my_operation"):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Async operation tracking  
async with performance_monitor.profile_async_operation("async_op"):
    await some_async_function()

# Get performance statistics
stats = performance_monitor.get_all_operation_stats()
summary = performance_monitor.get_performance_summary()
```

### Automatic Integration

All controller operations are automatically monitored when using the base controller's `start_operation()` method. No additional code required.

## Optimization Services

### Caching

The `OptimizationService` provides several caching mechanisms:

```python
optimization_service = service_factory.get_optimization_service()

# Cache expensive operations
@optimization_service.cached_operation(ttl_seconds=300)
async def expensive_operation(param):
    # Expensive computation
    return result

# Results are automatically cached and reused
```

### Operation Batching

Batch similar operations to reduce overhead:

```python
@optimization_service.batched_operation("data_processing", batch_size=10)
async def process_item(item):
    # Individual item processing
    return processed_item

# Multiple calls are automatically batched together
```

### Lazy Loading

Load resources only when needed:

```python
@optimization_service.lazy_loader("heavy_resource")
async def load_resource():
    # Load expensive resource
    return resource

# Resource is loaded once and cached
```

### Debouncing and Throttling

Control frequency of operations:

```python
@optimization_service.debounce(delay=0.5)
async def search_operation(query):
    # Search implementation
    return results

@optimization_service.throttle(calls_per_second=10)
async def api_call():
    # Rate-limited API call
    return response
```

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Use Async Operations

All controller operations should be async to avoid blocking the UI:

```python
# Good
async def load_configurations(self):
    result = await self.config_service.list_configurations()
    return result

# Avoid - blocks UI
def load_configurations_sync(self):
    result = self.config_service.list_configurations_sync()
    return result
```

### 2. Implement Caching

Cache expensive operations, especially configuration parsing and validation:

```python
@optimization_service.cached_operation(ttl_seconds=300)
async def validate_configuration(self, config_content):
    # Validation is expensive, cache results
    return validation_result
```

### 3. Batch Operations

Group similar operations together:

```python
# Instead of individual saves
for config in configurations:
    await save_configuration(config)

# Batch them
await batch_save_configurations(configurations)
```

### 4. Monitor Performance

Regular monitoring helps identify bottlenecks:

```python
# Get slow operations
slow_ops = performance_monitor.get_slow_operations(threshold=1.0)
for op in slow_ops:
    print(f"Slow operation: {op.name} took {op.duration:.2f}s")

# Analyze performance trends
analysis = await optimization_service.analyze_performance_bottlenecks()
print("Recommendations:", analysis['recommendations'])
```

## Performance Metrics

### Operation Metrics

- **Duration**: Time taken for each operation
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumed during operations
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Throughput**: Operations per second

### System Metrics

- **CPU Usage**: Current CPU utilization
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption
- **GUI Memory**: Application-specific memory usage
- **Active Operations**: Currently running operations

### Cache Metrics

- **Hit Ratio**: Percentage of cache hits vs misses
- **Cache Size**: Number of cached items
- **Eviction Rate**: How often items are removed from cache

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Slow Operations

1. **Identify**: Use `get_slow_operations()` to find problematic operations
2. **Analyze**: Check operation metadata for patterns
3. **Optimize**: Apply caching, batching, or async improvements
4. **Monitor**: Verify improvements with continued monitoring

### High Memory Usage

1. **Monitor**: Track memory usage trends over time
2. **Identify Leaks**: Look for consistently increasing memory
3. **Clean Up**: Clear caches and unused resources periodically
4. **Optimize**: Use lazy loading and resource pooling

### UI Responsiveness

1. **Async Operations**: Ensure all heavy operations are async
2. **Progress Updates**: Provide user feedback for long operations
3. **Debouncing**: Prevent rapid-fire operations (e.g., search)
4. **Background Processing**: Move heavy work to background threads

## Configuration

### Performance Thresholds

Configure performance alerts:

```python
performance_monitor.slow_operation_threshold = 2.0  # seconds
performance_monitor.memory_warning_threshold = 80.0  # percent
performance_monitor.cpu_warning_threshold = 90.0  # percent
```

### Cache Settings

Adjust cache behavior:

```python
# Operation cache
optimization_service.operation_cache = AsyncCache(
    maxsize=256,
    ttl_seconds=300
)

# Result cache  
optimization_service.result_cache = AsyncCache(
    maxsize=128,
    ttl_seconds=600
)
```

### Monitoring Intervals

Set monitoring frequency:

```python
# System metrics every 5 seconds
performance_monitor.start_monitoring(interval=5.0)

# Background analysis every 30 seconds
performance_monitor.monitoring_interval = 30.0
```

## Performance Dashboard

### Real-time Monitoring

The GUI can display real-time performance metrics:

- Current system resource usage
- Active operations and their progress
- Recent performance alerts
- Cache hit ratios and efficiency

### Historical Analysis

View performance trends over time:

- Operation duration trends
- Memory usage patterns
- System load history
- Performance improvement tracking

## Advanced Optimization

### Custom Optimization Strategies

Implement domain-specific optimizations:

```python
# Custom cache warming
await optimization_service.warm_up_caches([
    lambda: load_common_configurations(),
    lambda: preload_templates(),
    lambda: initialize_validators()
])

# Custom batching logic
await optimization_service.optimize_ui_operations([
    high_priority_operation,
    medium_priority_operation,
    low_priority_operation
])
```

### Performance Profiling

Deep performance analysis:

```python
# Profile specific operations
async with performance_monitor.profile_async_operation("complex_workflow") as metric:
    result = await complex_workflow()
    metric.metadata['items_processed'] = len(result)

# Analyze memory-intensive operations
memory_ops = performance_monitor.get_memory_intensive_operations(threshold_mb=50)
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always use async/await** for non-trivial operations
2. **Cache expensive computations** with appropriate TTL
3. **Batch similar operations** to reduce overhead
4. **Monitor performance continuously** in development
5. **Set appropriate thresholds** for your use case
6. **Clean up resources** to prevent memory leaks
7. **Use lazy loading** for heavy resources
8. **Debounce rapid user inputs** like search
9. **Provide progress feedback** for long operations
10. **Analyze performance data** to identify bottlenecks

## Integration with Existing Code

The performance system integrates seamlessly with existing controllers and services. No code changes are required for basic monitoring - it's automatically enabled when using the standard controller patterns.

For advanced optimization, simply add decorators to your methods and they'll automatically benefit from caching, batching, and other optimizations.
